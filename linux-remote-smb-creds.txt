This directory contains a root-only file which contains credentials to mount a windows box via fstab.

Also, I needed to install cifs-utils for this to work properly.

Here's the line in /etc/fstab which reads these credentials:
//windows-pc/Users /mnt/windows-pc cifs credentials=/opt/smbcreds/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0777,dir_mode=077 0 0
